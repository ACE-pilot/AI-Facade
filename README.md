**Human-factor-driven Automated Fa√ßade Design and Optimization**

## üîç Project Overview

**AI-Facade** is a research project that explores how physiological data can inform automated architectural fa√ßade design.
It establishes a closed-loop workflow linking **human-factor evidence**, **computational optimization**, and **parametric generation**.
By translating multimodal physiological signals‚Äîsuch as EEG‚Äîinto computable design objectives, the project leverages **multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)** to optimize fa√ßade geometry and materials.

The system integrates:

* Reinforcement learning using **PaddlePaddle-PARL** framework
* Human-factor metrics for adaptive fa√ßade optimization

This framework enables real-time, data-driven fa√ßade generation guided by human cognitive responses, bridging the gap between design performance and human perception.
